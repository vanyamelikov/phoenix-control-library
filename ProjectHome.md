Please report any issues and feature requests under the issues tab.

Visit the wiki and project page for details on [Usage](Usage.md).

I will do my best to address any change requests and add features. This is a side spare project I've started to address my needs and help new users. As such I need to balance this, other projects I'm working on and much needed free time.
